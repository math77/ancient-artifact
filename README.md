# Ancient artifact

An old, abandoned art project with the idea of creating celestial hardware onchain.

The hardware would have symbols that would be "programmed" in groups of 4 per artist.

During the days of lunar eclipses the owners of these devices would combine 4 different symbols of their choice and receive an artwork.
